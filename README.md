# Catfé

Contributors: Sara Siqueira, Yiyi Wang, Willy Lin, Victoria Chen

We built this website for a fictional cat cafe called Catfé, an environment conducive to relaxing or studying on the Tufts campus. 

We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jquery. 

This is our midtern project for COMP 20 Web Programming.
